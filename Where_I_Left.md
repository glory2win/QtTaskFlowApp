<h3> Where I left and what need to be done </h3>

Features need to be implemented:
<ol>
    <li> Implement right click context menu
    
</ol>

Know bugs and issues:

1. Todo list layout is setting only after clicking on any category item. It needs to be done after creation of UI upon load. See what happen when click on any Cateogry item apply that logic there.
2. 


Impl
>> rename - done
>> duplicate
>> delete

Rename Category:
1. first cache the old name, and enable setEditable, and mode is editinging
2. after hit enter emit rename mode with that category item and cahced old name
