App is at stable state, I can able to read JSON data and creating UIs with status successfully.
Now need to add the newly created todo items into the selecte/currCategory in presenter.
Call presenter's slot from view (emit) so it will gather needed information from loaded stuff
and call view to create the to do item. In this way it will be sync to model.

Later can implement context menu to delete todo items or categories, first emit, handle in presenter
update ui.
